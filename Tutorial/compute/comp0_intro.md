# **Comp 1: Introduction**

The purpose here is to make a simple compute shader. It will take an array as input (storage buffer), make a sum and put the result in an second array (storage buffer).

In order to have a distinct part between the rendering pipeline and the compute pipeline, all the code for the compute pipeline creation will be written between step 13 and step 14. Moreover, the code written in step 14 and 15 is going to be modified in section Comp 5, 6 and 7.
